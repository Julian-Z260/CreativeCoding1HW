This is the very first time I have ever done anything with coding and even with this I am not sure if I am doing it right.  When looking to see what we have to do for this assignment it seems like we
have to create a txt file which I don't even know what to do so this may be incorrect.  From what I could find between the difference of GUI vs CLI is that GUI lets the user interact with with graphical elements while CLI lets the user interact with the devices elements.

This is testing a commit from my computer.
